Advent of Code

My solutions to the annual Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/). 

Not always pretty and some don't even work. In many cases the code commited is for part 2 of the problem with the part 1 code either commented out or no longer working.

All in Java, which is what I'm most familiar with. I really should try this in a different language one year!
